This course was inspired by many other courses / resources that cover similar material. In addition to my own developed material, I have also modified material from other courses and workshops - a full list of sources can be found in the [LICENSE](LICENSE.html) page.

This course was originally created by Dr. Nicolás Sacco at the Population Research Center - Portland State University for the Spring 2026 semester.
