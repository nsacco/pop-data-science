Having successfully completed this course, students will be able to:

- Develop and implement demographic analyses using R by:
    - Employing modular and reproducible coding practices for population data analysis.

    - Writing well-documented R scripts and Quarto notebooks to conduct demographic computations.

    - Applying computational problem-solving skills to real demographic datasets (e.g., censuses, vital statistics, surveys).

- Compute and interpret key demographic indicators, including:
    - Crude and age-specific fertility and mortality rates.
    - Total fertility rate (TFR), mean age at childbearing, and life expectancy.
    - Measures of population growth, dependency ratios, and age structure.

- Work confidently with demographic data sources by:
    - Importing, cleaning, and validating data from major repositories (WPP, HMD, HFD, IPUMS, DEIS).
    - Assessing data quality, completeness, and comparability across sources.
    - Managing and transforming datasets using tidyverse tools.

- Reproducibly visualize and communicate demographic patterns by:
    - Creating clear and informative graphics (e.g., population pyramids, Lexis diagrams, time trends).
    - Applying effective data visualization principles using ggplot2 and related packages.
    - Producing Quarto-based reports integrating code, text, and visual output.

- Engage with emerging areas of digital and computational demography by:
    - Collecting data via web scraping and APIs.
    - Mapping demographic data using spatial analysis tools (`sf`, `tmap`).
    - Exploring microsimulation and kinship modeling approaches (`socsim`, `kinship2`).
