This course provides a foundation in **demographic analysis and programming using the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/)**. It introduces students to the fundamentals of data analysis and visualization in the context of population studies, emphasizing reproducible and transparent research practices. Topics covered include demographic principles (fertility, mortality, migration, and population composition), data sources (censuses, vital statistics, surveys, and international databases), and computational methods for analyzing and visualizing population trends using R.

Students will learn to work with major demographic datasets such as the **World Population Prospects (WPP)**, **Human Mortality Database (HMD)**, **Human Fertility Database (HFD)**, and national sources like **DEIS** and **IPUMS**. Through hands-on labs, students will gain experience in importing, cleaning, transforming, and visualizing data, and in calculating standard demographic indicators including crude rates, age-specific rates, and total fertility rates.

Emphasis will be on producing clear, reproducible, and interpretable analyses using best practices in data science. Students will primarily complete individual programming assignments and applied demographic labs designed to build their technical and conceptual understanding. Assessment will include weekly labs, a midterm data quality project, and a final reproducible demographic analysis using Quarto. The course assumes no prior experience with R and is ideal preparation for advanced courses in **applied demography, data analytics, and population research**.
